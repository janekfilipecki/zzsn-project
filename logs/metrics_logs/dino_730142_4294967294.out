The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
	`--num_processes` was set to a value of `1`
	`--num_machines` was set to a value of `1`
	`--mixed_precision` was set to a value of `'no'`
	`--dynamo_backend` was set to a value of `'no'`
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.

Some weights of ViTModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/dino-vitb16 and are newly initialized: ['pooler.dense.bias', 'pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
